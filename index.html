        <p>"Let It Be" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, released on 6 March 1970 as a single, and as the title track of their album Let It Be. It was written and sung by Paul McCartney, and credited to the Lennonâ€“McCartney partnership. At the time, it had the highest debut on the Billboard Hot 100, beginning its chart run at number 6 and eventually reaching the top. It was their final single before McCartney announced his departure from the band.
          2020 is 50th year that this song has come out. Let's celebrate with each other for this song!!
